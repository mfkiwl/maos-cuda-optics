   The following shows how various components are implemented.
 

   \section Fundementals

   \section Auxiliary
   
   \subsection Sodium range variation

   The sodium range variation is specified through the LLT configuration key
   llt.fnrange in llt_CL.song or llt_SL.conf. When supplied by user, use
   powfs0_llt.fnrange. The file should contain additional change (wrt fnprof) of
   sodium height in meters with dimension nx1 or nxnLGS where n can be less
   than, equal to or greater than the length of simulation and nLGS is the
   number of LGS in this powfs (6 for NFIRAOS).
