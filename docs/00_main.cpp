    Multi-Thread Adaptive Optics Simulator (MAOS) is a end-to-end adaptive
    optics system simulator. It has the capability to simulate all kinds of
    astronominal adaptive optics systems, including conventional single
    conjugate AO (SCAO), multi-conjugate AO (MCAO), laser tomography AO (LTAO),
    multi-object AO (MOAO), and ground layer AO (GLAO).

    Some benchmarking results using the TMT NFIRAOS (30 m aperture, 6 LGS, dual order 60x60 DM):
    - Dual Intel Xeon W5590 at 3.33 Ghz: 1.3 s per time step with 8 threads.
    - Intel Core i7-2600 at 3.4 Ghz: 1.9s per time step with 4 threads.
    - Intel Core i7-2600 at 3.4 Ghz: 1.67s per time step with 8 hyper threads (4 physical cores).
    - Nvidia GTX 580 GPU: 0.2s per time step
    - 8x Nvidia GTX 580 GPU: 0.03s per time step
